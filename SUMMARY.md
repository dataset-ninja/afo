**AFO: Aerial Dataset of Floating Objects** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the search and rescue (SAR) industry. 

The dataset consists of 3640 images with 119973 labeled objects belonging to 9 different classes including *object*, *small_obj*, *human*, and other: *large_obj*, *wind/sup-board*, *kayak*, *boat*, *bouy*, and *sailboat*.

Images in the AFO dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 728 (20% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (2787 images), *test* (514 images), and *validation* (339 images).
