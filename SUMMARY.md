**AFO: Aerial Dataset of Floating Objects** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the Search and Rescue (SAR) industry. 

The dataset consists of 3640 images with 119973 labeled objects belonging to 9 different classes including *object*, *small_obj*, *human*, and other: *large_obj*, *wind/sup-board*, *kayak*, *boat*, *bouy*, and *sailboat*.

Images in the AFO dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 728 (20% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (514 images), *train* (2787 images), and *validation* (339 images). The dataset was released in 2021 by the [AGH University of Science and Technology, Poland](https://www.agh.edu.pl/en/).
