The authors of the dataset present a comprehensive study focusing on leveraging deep learning architectures for marine search and rescue operations involving object detection. They introduce a novel dataset, named the Aerial-Drone Floating Objects (AFO) dataset, which is designed for maritime search and rescue purposes. 

Highlighting the significance of the study, the authors discuss the challenges associated with search and rescue operations, emphasizing the difficulties in localizing missing individuals and objects. They emphasize the potential benefits of incorporating unmanned aerial vehicles, artificial intelligence, and computer vision technologies to enhance rescue missions. While these technologies offer promising assistance, the authors underscore the scarcity of object detection systems based on neural networks in SAR applications, partly due to the lack of sufficiently large training datasets.

To address this limitation, the authors present the AFO dataset, which is meticulously curated for the problem of detecting small objects in marine environments. This dataset consists of 3647 images, each manually annotated with nearly 40,000 labeled objects. The dataset is divided into three subsets: training, test, and validation. The authors also elaborate on the considerations for data selection, including altitude and angle restrictions for video recordings, as well as the inclusion of various environmental and weather conditions in the dataset.

Each class here belongs to one of three dataset versions (depending on the goal of the CV task): **6categories** version (classes *human*, *wind/sup-board*, *kayak*, *boat*, *bouy*, *sailboat*) to check how accurately detectors can detect humans vs. other floating objects (<i>a large data imbalance `</i>`); **2categories** version (classes *small_obj*, *large_obj*) to the task of searching for missing people (small objects) and boats (large objects) (<i>slightly more balanced `</i>`); **1category** version (class *object*) which marks all bounding boxes as one class to reflect the fact that usually during search and rescue operations at the sea, finding any object of a human origin can be significant.
