Each class belongs to one of three dataset versions (depending on the goal of the CV task): **6categories** version (classes *human*, *wind/sup-board*, *kayak*, *boat*, *bouy*, *sailboat*) to check how accurately detectors can detect humans vs. other floating objects (`<i>`a large data imbalance `</i>`); **2categories** version (classes *small_obj*, *large_obj*) to the task of searching for missing people (small objects) and boats (large objects) (`<i>`slightly more balanced `</i>`); **1category** version (class *object*) which marks all bounding boxes as one class to reflect the fact that usually during search and rescue operations at the sea, finding any object of a human origin can be significant.
